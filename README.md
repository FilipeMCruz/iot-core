# IoT Core Library for Sensae Console

This library is used to handle the structure, behavior and semantic of messages inside Sensae Console and Business Applications that interact with Sensae Console.

This project is unmaintained and discontinued, it is not ready for production and no support related to it will ever be given.
This project is here solely for demonstrations purposes as it was part of the work related to my master's thesis.

Current Version: `0.1.21`
